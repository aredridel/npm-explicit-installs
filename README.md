# npm front page packages

This is the list of packages that appears on the [home page](https://npmjs.com). It is generated by an occasional, one-off data crunch which counts how many times a package name appears in an "npm install" command. This is not the same as downloads, since most packages are installed as dependencies of other packages. This metric tends to surface packages that people start with, and also frequently used CLI tools.

## How to get your package on the front page

* You can't. Please don't ask.
* You also cannot pay to be on this list. It is selected for usefulness to new users.
* Because these are manually selected after the job is run, there is no way to game this metric.
